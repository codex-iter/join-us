*Codex* is the official coding community of [Institute of Technical Education and Research](http://iter.ac.in/).
We bring in budding coders as well as the experienced ones and give them a platform to meet, share their knowledge and work on building awesome projects.
We also collaborate with coding community around Bhubaneswar to increase the exposure of the members of the club.
You can find our work [here](https://github.com/codex-iter).

### **Read the below document to learn more about the evaluation process.**

* Step 1: Have a [Github](https://github.com/) account. Please take time to learn how Github works.
	You can get help [here](https://guides.github.com/)

* Step 2: Complete the first 10 questions of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).
	**Please verify your answers on the website.**
	
	You can do this by making an account and submitting your output on the respective problem pages.
	
	Push it to a repository in your Github account in the following format.
	
	- Repository should be named 'project-euler' or something similar
	- Filenames should have proper extensions. (Yeah, we know)
	- Filenames should be numbered according to problem number.
	- Add the question statement as comments on top of your solution.
	- The question only needs to print out the final output and need not take any input as it is already provided in the question.
	- Write down your ouput in a comment.
	- Please make optimisations by yourself, as we will check how optimised your code is and ask you to improve it anyways.
	
* Step 3: After completion ping us in the group with the following details.

	- Name.
	- email-id.
	- Branch, Section and Semester. 
	- Phone no.
	- Github link to your euler project solutions repository.
	
	Please write all of this in one message. #TIP: You can edit messages on telegram.
	
	If @admins tell you to change something, after making changes you can ping us with the hashtag #updated.
	It is ideal that you reply with your github repository link for easier access for @admins.
	
* Step 4: After successful evaluation, you will be assigned with a minor project along with a time limit.
	(NOT MANDATORY FOR FRESHMEN)

* Step 5: Once you succesfully complete the minor project, you will get invited to the club.

If you reached this part - and still don't know what to do - We assume you don't know programming.
You can start with some tutorials we have on our [organisation page](https://github.com/codex-iter) itself. Or follow some course online (links provided in the tutorials).

Thanks and good luck.
